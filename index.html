					<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<p>
					Technology jobs are on the rise and have become some of the most coveted jobs in our society,
					particularly software development roles, however few minorities occupy these spaces.
					Although data exists on the lack of diversity in tech, many people do not understand
					the crucial and nuanced personal experiences that affect minorities in tech, specifically women.

					<h2>Game</h2>
					<p>
						Use your keyboard arrows to avoid oncoming obstacles.
						The more obstacles you hit, the lower your fuel tank.
						When your tank hits 0, you must exit your career in technology :(

					<h2>Game</h2>
					<p>
						Unfortunately, over half of women in tech end up exiting the tech industry at mid-levels,
						citing many of the reasons that we have called out here. In fact,
						women leave the technology industry at a rate 45% higher than men.

						<h2>Pay Gap</h2>
						<p>
							“The gender wage gap is smallest among candidates in their 20s,
							and grows as they increase in age.”
						</p>
						<p>
							“Women just starting off in their careers both expect and
							receive salaries that more closely align with the salaries
							offered to men with similar years of experience.”
						</p>
						<p><em>Let's dig deeper...</em></p>
						<br>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Men are offered higher salaries than women
							for the same job at the same company
							 <strong> 63% of the time </strong>
						 </p>
						<p>Women are offered
							<strong> 4% less </strong>
							than men on average for the same role at
							the same company
						</p>
						<p> <strong> More than half </strong>
							of women know they’ve been paid less
							than men in similar roles throughout their careers
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Additionally, as women get older,
							they’re also more likely to have children, which is also linked to lower salaries.
						</p>
						<br>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>The situation is worse for women of color or those who identify as LGBTQ.

						<p>“A 2013 analysis found that half of female STEM
							professionals leave the field within 12 years,
							compared with less than 20 percent of women in other
							professional fields...A 2016 report from the National Center for Women and
							Information Technology (NCWIT) blames the retention issue on
							‘workplace conditions, a lack of access to key creative roles,
							and a sense of feeling stalled in one’s career.’”

						<h2>Poor culture around work-life balance</h2>
						<p>
							A survey of over 1,000 women in tech found that 83% of mothers felt pressured to return early from maternity leave. 38% of respondents cited a fear of losing credibility or value.
							 34% said they were directly pressured by colleagues or managers.
							 32% of the women feared losing their jobs.
