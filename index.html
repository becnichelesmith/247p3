				<!-- Intro -->

				<section>
					<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<p>
				Technology jobs are on the rise and have become some
				of the most coveted jobs in our society, particularly software development roles.
				Although diversity in technology companies is frequently discussed today,
				most tech companies are still struggling to hire and keep women and other
				minority groups in their companies. This explorable explanation hopes to give you a
				glimpse into the harsh reality women in tech face.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>So, what now?</h2>
					<p>
					We built a game that will feature some of the main reasons women leave tech. We'll show you how to play it.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>First things first..</h2>
					<p>
					This is a classic driving game.
					You drive, you dodge obstacles, you last as long as possible while picking up the occassional powerup.
					However, we modified it to make things a little bit more interesting..
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Obstacles!</h2>
					<img src="images/obstacles.svg" height="300px" >
					<p>
					These are the obstacles you'll be facing in the game. These obstacles represent <em>real</em> things that women
					and other minority groups face in the tech industry. We'll go through them now...
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Awareness</h2>
					<img src="gameImages/awareness.png" height="300px" >
					<p>
					This obstacle represents 'Awareness', that is, how many men in tech lack it. Almost 1/3
					of men in the tech industry think sexism isn't a problem.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Harassment</h2>
					<img src="gameImages/harassment.png" height="300px" >
					<p>
					This obstacle represents 'Harassment'. Be it physical or verbal, many women edure this at work.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Language</h2>
					<img src="gameImages/language.png" height="300px" >
					<p>
					This obstacle represents 'Language'. Sexist language is extremely prevelant and makes female workers uncomfortable.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Maternity Leave</h2>
					<img src="gameImages/maternity_leave.png" height="300px" >
					<p>
					This obstacle represents 'Maternity Leave'. Women get implicitly punished for starting families.
					They're seen as 'less serious' about their career.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Mentorship and Promotions</h2>
					<img src="gameImages/mentorship-promotions.png" height="300px" >
					<p>
					This obstacle represents 'Mentorship and Promotions'.
					Women frequently get skipped over for promotions and don't
					have many opportunities for mentorship.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Pay Gap</h2>
					<img src="gameImages/pay.png" height="300px" >
					<p>
					This obstacle represents 'Pay Gap'. The longer a woman stays in tech, the larger the pay gap.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Workplace Culture</h2>
					<img src="gameImages/workplace_culture.png" height="300px" >
					<p>
					This obstacle represents 'Workplace Culture'. Hypermasculinity in the workplace makes many women feel alienated.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>wow..</h2>
					<p>
					That was a lot of obstacles! What keeps women from dropping out immediately?
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>POWERUPS!</h2>
					<img src="images/powerups.png" height="300px" >
					<p>
					These powerups will increase your total health and keep you in the tech industry (and game) longer.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Flexible Hours</h2>
					<img src="gameImages/flexible_hours.png" height="300px" >
					<p>
					This powerup represents 'Flexible Hours'.
					[info]
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Networking</h2>
					<img src="gameImages/network.png" height="300px" >
					<p>
					This powerup represents the power of 'Networking'. Having a community is important for any job,
					especially one in which you are apart of a minority.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Elminate Bias</h2>
					<img src="gameImages/network.png" height="300px" >
										<p>
					This obstacle represents 'Eliminating Bias'. [info]
					</p>
				</section>

				<!--Game -->

				<section>
					<h2>It's game time!</h2>
					<p>
						You're a woman in the tech industry. This game is your journey to the top..
						There's no end to this game; just try to last as long as you possibly can.
					 	Use your keyboard arrows to avoid oncoming obstacles.
						The more obstacles you hit, the lower your fuel tank.
						When your tank hits 0, you must pull over your career in technology :(
					</p>

				<section>
					<h2>Game Over</h2>
					<p>
						Unfortunately, over half of women in tech end up exiting the tech industry at mid-levels,
						citing many of the reasons that we have called out here. In fact,
						women leave the technology industry at a rate 45% higher than men.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Let's unpack that</h2>
					<p>
					Now that you've tried our little game, let's do a deep dive into some of the main reasons women
					leave the tech industry.

						<h2>Pay Gap</h2>
						<p>
							“The gender wage gap is smallest among candidates in their 20s,
							and grows as they increase in age.”
						</p>
						<p>
							“Women just starting off in their careers both expect and
							receive salaries that more closely align with the salaries
							offered to men with similar years of experience.”
						</p>
						<p><em>Let's dig deeper...</em></p>
						<br>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Men are offered higher salaries than women
							for the same job at the same company
							 <strong> 63% of the time </strong>
						 </p>
						<p>Women are offered
							<strong> 4% less </strong>
							than men on average for the same role at
							the same company
						</p>
						<p> <strong> More than half </strong>
							of women know they’ve been paid less
							than men in similar roles throughout their careers
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Additionally, as women get older,
							they’re also more likely to have children, which is also linked to lower salaries.
						</p>
						<br>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>The situation is worse for women of color or those who identify as LGBTQ.

							Roughly ⅓ of men (32%) say discrimination against women is not a problem

					<section>
						<p>“A 2013 analysis found that half of female STEM
							professionals leave the field within 12 years,
							compared with less than 20 percent of women in other
							professional fields...A 2016 report from the National Center for Women and
							Information Technology (NCWIT) blames the retention issue on
							‘workplace conditions, a lack of access to key creative roles,
							and a sense of feeling stalled in one’s career.’”

						<h2>Poor culture around work-life balance</h2>
						<p>
							A survey of over 1,000 women in tech found that 83% of mothers felt pressured to return early from maternity leave. 38% of respondents cited a fear of losing credibility or value.
							 34% said they were directly pressured by colleagues or managers.
							 32% of the women feared losing their jobs.
